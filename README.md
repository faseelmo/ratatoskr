Welcome to the project website of ratatoskr, an in-depth PPA framework to design NoCs. It can model 2D, 3D and heterogeneous 3D SoCs. It ships a router hardware model and precise power models. It supports uniform random traffic patterns, netrace and task graphs.

- Power estimation:
  - Static and dynamic power estimation of routers and links on a cycle-accurate level.
  - Accuracy of dynamic link energy is within 1% of bit-level accurate simulations.
- Performance models:
  - Network performance on a cycle-accurate (CA) level using the NoC simulator.  
  - Network performance on a register-transfer level (RTL).
  - Timing of routers from synthesis.
- Area analysis from synthesis on gate-level for any standard cell technology.
- Benchmarks:
   - Netrace
   - Realistic application model on transaction-level.
   - Synthetic traffic patterns.
- Heterogeneous 3D Integration:
   - Pseudo-mesochronous routers
   - Heterogeneous network architectures.
- Reporting: Automatic generation of detailed reports from network-scale performance to buffer utilization.

Ratatoskr  is developed at the RWTH Aachen University, Germany, OVG University Magdeburg, Germany and University of Bremen, Germany. It is under MIT license terms. If you use the simulator in your research, we would appreciate the following citation in any publications to which it has contributed:

## Trivia on the framework's name

The name of the framework Ratatoskr is based on a squirrel from Nordic mythology. In the mythological text, the squirrel runs up and down a large tree called Yggdrasil to transport message from an eagle sitting on top of the tree to the dragon Nidhögg lying under the tree. The eagle and the dragon are quite talkative because they are in conflict. Thus, the squirrel is rather busy with its task. The inspiration of the name of our framework comes directly from the squirrels task: Just as a NoC in a heterogeneous 3D SoC, it transmits messages vertically to different senders and receivers.


## Getting started

Here, we provide a quick tutorial. For in-depth instructions, please visit the [documentation](docs/TOC.md).

Let's start simple. You can a virtualbox image from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wDSwk0DIyzxVyD3pfzP4sBhK69QrsxN1). Boot it, login with demo/demo (user/pass). You'll find the simulator in ~/ratatoskr. We'll start from there. Let's start a terminal! (If you'd like to install the simulator on your own system, please read the detailed documentation in [the docs](TOC.md).

```bash
cd ~/ratatoskr
```

In this demo system, we already installed all packages and ratatoskr, so you are ready to go. Let's first get the newest version:

```bash
git pull
```

and compile:

```bash
cd ~/ratatoskr/simulator
./build.sh
```

After a short time, you'll get the executable `sim`. Let's run three simple examples!

## Simulating a NoC for a heterogeneous 3D SoCs

In this part, we'll simulate a NoC for a heterogeneous 3D SoC with two 30nm mixed-signal layers on top an a single 15nm digital layer on bottom. We'll use XYZ routing, as published from *Joseph et al. 2019*, and load uniform random traffic. The result will look like this:

![Heterogeneous Traffic](bin/demo/uniform_hetero_network.gif)

Let's generate this figure. Enter the demo folder and copy the executable and the configuration files:

```bash
cd ~/ratatoskr/bin/demo
cp ~/ratatoskr/simulator/sim .
```

We'll the the python venv and copy the required files for the GUI:

```bash
cd ~/ratatoskr/bin/
make
source source_me.sh
cd ~/ratatoskr/bin/demo
cp config/network_heterogeneous.xml network.xml #will be read as network config file for plotting.
python ../plot_network_client.py
```

The GUI script is started and waits for the simulation to run. Let's open a second terminal, in which you run the simulator:

```bash
cp config/config_heterogeneous.xml config/config.xml
cd ~/ratatoskr/bin/demo
./sim
```

## Different traffic patterns

In this part, we'll run uniform random traffic pattern and hotspot traffic pattern and visualize the differences with our GUI. We'll use simple homogeneous networks for comparability to conventional NoCs. Copy the correct configuration files. In the `config` folder, you'll find the configuration of the simulator (`config_homogeneous.xml`) and the network, a 4 * 4 * 3 - NoC (`network.xml`). They are already set up for the uniform random traffic pattern. The simulation is set to 1.5M clock cycles, which will take a while. But that's enough to observe the behavior of the NoC in the GUI! Let's to that:

```bash
cp config/config_homogeneous.xml config/config.xml #for simulator
cp config/network.xml network.xml # for GUI
```

Rerun the simulation by executing `python ../plot_network_client.py` in the first terminal and `./sim` in the second.  A GUI will open and show the buffer usage in each router. It's somewhat random...!

![Uniform Random Traffic XYZ](bin/demo/uniform.gif)

At the end of the simulation after a few minutes, you'll see the performance results:

```
Generating report of the simulation run into file report ...  done.
Average flit latency: 13.86 ns.
Average packet latency: 46.64 ns.
Average network latency: 46.64 ns.
```

Next, let's use hotspot traffic pattern. Therefore, we configure the simulator. Close the GUI by pressing `q` in the window or using `Crtl-C` in the terminal. Change line 26 of the `config/config.xml` file from

```xml
<phase name="run">
  <distribution value="uniform"/>
  <start max="1100" min="1100"/>
```
to
```xml
<phase name="run">
  <distribution value="hotspot"/>
  <start max="1100" min="1100"/>
```

Rerun the simulation by executing `python ../plot_network_client.py` in the first terminal and `./sim` in the second. You'll recieve a rather boring but expected network load:

![Hotspot Traffic](bin/demo/hotspot.gif)

## Different routing algorithms

Let's use the heterogeneous XYZ routing, which puts more load to lower layers. This differs from conventional XYZ routing. Therefore, we reconfigure the `config/network.xml` by changing the router properties in lines 12, 19, and 26 from

```xml
<nodeType id="0">
     <model value="RouterVC"/>
     <routing value="XYZ"/>
     <selection value="1stFreeVC"/>
     <clockDelay value="1"/>
     <arbiterType value="fair"/>
   </nodeType>
```
to
```xml
<nodeType id="0">
     <model value="RouterVC"/>
     <routing value="HeteroXYZ"/>
     <selection value="1stFreeVC"/>
     <clockDelay value="1"/>
     <arbiterType value="fair"/>
   </nodeType>
```
Remember to repeat three times! Also, we'll use uniform random traffic again, so update the `config/config.xml` (revert the changes made before).

Finally, you'll receive the following:
