# Netrace mode

The netrace mode is more hard-coded, with much less configuration options.
It can be compiled using `cmake -D DEFINE_ENABLE_NETRACE=ON`

You can use a 2D or a 3D mode.
In 2D mode, the netrace cores are mapped to a 8x8 NoC.
In 3D mode, the cores are mapped to a 4x4x2 NoC.
The modes can be toggled using `GlobalResources::netrace2Dor3Dmode`.

Netrace relies on trace files from [here](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~netrace/).

The netrace configuration is exemplified by the folder `simulator/tests/netrace`.

Both 2D and 3D mode use the same fixed (!) config file for the network.
It is an 8x8x2 NoC.
Mapping for both modes is different, see `GlobalResources.cpp`, lines 44ff.;
`GlobalResources::netraceNodeToTask`.
Do not change the config file as some parameters are hard coded.

In the netrace mode, the simulator always will read the `config/ntConfig.xml` file.
The file defines the `network.xml` used; you should use the same as in `simulator/tests/netrace/config/ntNetwork.xml`. It defines the aforementioned 8x8x2 NoC, which allows for flexibly map 64 cores of the netrace benchmark (e.g., to a 4x4x2 or a 8x8x1 setting). The mapping can be changed in [ll. 118-119, NetracePool.cpp](https://github.com/jmjos/ratatoskr/blob/89be71877a04b6469dbb9588e89e38911b8a4cc8/simulator/src/model/traffic/netrace/NetracePool.cpp#L119). At this stage, it maps to 4x4x2 by adding 32 to respective PE-adresses.

You can change the benchmark trace file in `ntConfig.xml`, `<netraceFile>config/example.tra.bz2</netraceFile>`

Alternatively, you can use the command line arguments provided: `--simTime` for the simulation time, `--netraceStartRegion` (with an int from 0 to 5) for the start region, default is PARSEC's ROI, and `--netraceTraceFile` for the trace file destination.

If you want to change the topology, buffers depth and number of VC, please update `ntNetwork.xml` accordingly using text replace. A nicer high-level interface is a planned feature.

## FAQ

### Can I use different topologies?

Per default, the netrace mode can be used with a 4x4x2 or a 8x8 NoC as explained above. For this, we provide the `ntConfig.xml` file that defines a 8x8x2 NoC from which relevant parts are used by mapping accordingly. Of course, one can use their own topology. Then, a different `ntConfig.xml` must be generated in correct format.

### How are the packet sizes calculated?

Netrace provides a list of packet sizes within the benchmark files (cf. [tech report](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~netrace/download/TR-10-11.pdf), Table 2). Conversion of these packet sizes is done in Ratatoskr according to the bit-width of a single flit. It is assumed that the headflit does not contain payload data for the sake of simplicity. We kindly refer to ll. 176-188 in [ProcessingElement.cpp](https://github.com/jmjos/ratatoskr/blob/89be71877a04b6469dbb9588e89e38911b8a4cc8/simulator/src/model/processingElement/ProcessingElementVC.cpp#L176)
